# Ganttoday
This is a simpel extension for the [Gantter project](http://gantter.com).
It displays all tasks in your Gantt projects that:

* Have not been completed 100%.
* Have no predecessors that have not started (SS) or completed (FS).
* Have no constraint date (SNET or MSO) that prevents it from starting.

You can use this extension to turn Gantter in a dependecy-enabled task manager.
